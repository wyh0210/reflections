Created by a UK-based designer, this infographic highlights beautiful data visualization of 34,000 meteorites that have fallen on the Earth. You will discover the map and timeline of the impacts per year, wrapped up in clean, stylish graphics. The visualization also shows spikes on the records and comparing the size of the biggest meteorites recorded. 

Meteorites hit almost all of Earth’s surface, but some areas seem untouched; this phenomenon could be connected with Earth’s magnetic fields. And who knows –  the future may bring us even more meteorites to explore! 

If you’re a fan of space and astronomy, you can learn more about meteorites from NASA website or check out this database of the Meteoritical Society.
