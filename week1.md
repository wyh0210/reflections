The civil engineering feats of humankind have reached the highest peaks of the mountains and deep into the ocean, and we have built pyramids, temples and statues that are still standing today.

The seven wonders of the ancient world are a collection of man-made structures that are considered to be remarkable feats at the time they were built.

Pranav Gavali, a Data Scientist, created this graphic using data from Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia to visualize the world's seven ancient wonders along with their features and modern-day locations.

The graphic perfectly illustrates how the seven wonders were built and why they are considered a wonder of the world. The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
