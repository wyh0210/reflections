Based on data on the distribution of total plastic waste generation by continent, Jamie Kettle created this personal project to estimate the percentage of the plastic waste that was inadequately disposed of. 

The infographic provides a clear and precise picture on current surface plastic mass by ocean, measuring it in a creative way. We can see plastic waste management for every country in a colored bar chart. The names of the countries that report 100% of all their plastic waste handled properly are highlighted in bold. 

One of the major findings here is that the GDP of the country and efficient plastic waste management aren’t always correlated – you can see it by irregular patterns shown in the infographic.
